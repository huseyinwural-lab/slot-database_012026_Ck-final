# Optional: Traefik external reverse proxy example (copy-paste starting point)
# Assumption:
# - Single VM
# - Traefik runs on host (or as its own docker compose stack)
# - LetsEncrypt via ACME
# - Your app docker-compose.prod.yml publishes:
#   - admin UI on :3000
#   - player UI on :3001
#
# Notes:
# - This file is intentionally minimal and may need adaption to your environment.
# - The UI containers already proxy /api/* internally to backend:8001.

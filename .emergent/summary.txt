<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary objective is a large-scale, dual-language (English and Turkish) documentation overhaul for a full-stack casino platform. The initial problem of a failing CI/CD pipeline and an admin panel Network Error on preview deployments has been explicitly deprioritized by the user until the documentation is complete. However, with the documentation work now largely finished, the focus has shifted to fixing the CI/CD pipeline to unblock deployments and final verification.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
The user has provided a comprehensive, 40-point plan for the documentation effort, which has been the main focus. Now, the project is moving to the next phase of fixing core infrastructure blockers and addressing backend gaps.

1.  **Comprehensive Documentation (P0 - LARGELY COMPLETE):** Create a new, structured documentation suite in both English and Turkish under .
2.  **Documentation-as-Code (P0 - IN PROGRESS):** Implement and progressively enhance a CI smoke test () to validate documentation quality.
3.  **Backend Gap Register (P1 - IN PROGRESS):** Create and maintain a central markdown file () to track discrepancies between frontend API calls and backend implementations. This has now been hardened into an actionable work board.
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline Stability (P0 - DONE):** The  workflow must pass.
5.  **Admin Panel Accessibility (P2 - RESOLVED):** The user must be able to log into the admin panel on preview deployments. The issue resolved itself after the CI fix.
6.  **Refactor Tenant Creation (P0 - DONE):** Restrict tenant creation to super admins only.
7.  **Create Release Readiness Checklist (P1 - DONE):** A new operational document to ensure stable releases.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack casino platform (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL). A significant amount of work in this session focused on stabilizing the development lifecycle and improving operational readiness.

The critical CI/CD pipeline failure caused by a  drift has been diagnosed and fixed. The Network Error on the admin panel login has resolved itself post-fix and is no longer reproducible.

Two major documentation artifacts were created:
1.  A comprehensive, dual-language **Release Readiness Checklist** () to serve as a GO/NO-GO gate for deployments.
2.  The existing **Backend Gap Register** has been enhanced into a Kapanabilir İş Panosu (Actionable Work Board) with a triage summary table, standardized fields (Owner, SLA, Status), and a clear status workflow ( →  →  → ).

Finally, Verification Contracts (explicit acceptance criteria including API endpoints and UI steps) have been defined for the top 3 priority gaps (G-001, G-002, G-003) within the register.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user has decided to proceed with implementing the fixes for the identified backend gaps, starting with G-001. The agent was asked to choose between two approaches: (A) Design the implementation for the development team or (B) Provide the checklist and acceptance criteria. The agent chose **A**. The immediate next task is to design the backend implementation for the  gap.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** backend testing agent (Once the implementation is complete, to validate against the defined verification contract).
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your immediate task is to design the backend implementation for the  gap.** The user selected option A, meaning you should produce pseudo-code, route definitions, and model structures before writing the actual code.
-   **The Verification Contracts in  are the non-negotiable acceptance criteria.** All implementation work must satisfy these contracts.
-   **The project has pivoted from fixing infrastructure (CI) to active development.** The priority is to clear the backend gaps, starting with G-001, G-002, and G-003 in that order.
-   The user is highly technical and prefers clear, structured plans and evidence-based progress. Stick to the agreed-upon plan.
-   Continue to respond in **Turkish**.

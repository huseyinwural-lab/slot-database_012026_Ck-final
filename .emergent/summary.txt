<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's goal is to build a comprehensive, feature-rich admin panel for a casino operation. The primary focus is expanding the Game Management module with advanced configuration options for Poker, Blackjack, Slots, Crash, and Dice games.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (V1 Definition):**
*   **P0-A: Crash & Dice Advanced Config Finalization (COMPLETED):** Fully implement, test (E2E), and document the Advanced Safety features for Crash and Advanced Limits for Dice.
*   **P0-B: Slot Config Finalization (COMPLETED):** Ensure all Slot configuration tabs (General, RTP, Bets, Features, Paytable, Reels, Jackpots, Advanced) have a working E2E data round-trip (UI -> API -> DB -> UI).
*   **P0-C: Minimum Version Diff Visibility (COMPLETED):** Implement a UI in the Logs/Versions view to show which configuration fields have changed between versions.
*   **P0-D: Test Game Inventory (COMPLETED):** Ensure at least one test game exists for each core game type (Slot, Poker, Blackjack, Crash, Dice), marked with .
*   **P0-E: Game Robot (MVP) (UPCOMING):** Create a minimal, script-based Game Robot to simulate gameplay on test games (Slot, Crash, Dice) to verify game logic and safety limits at the API level.
*   **P0-F: Unity Integration Checklist (UPCOMING):** Create a markdown document outlining the step-by-step process for integrating a Unity game with the admin panel.
*   **P0-G: Admin Panel Runbook (UPCOMING):** Write a  (user manual) for operators.
*   **P1: Hardening (DEFINED):** Define and validate a suite of negative edge-case tests for Jackpot, Blackjack, and Poker configurations.

**User's preferred language**: **Turkish**. The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) with a Game Management module.
- **Advanced Configs:** Crash, Dice, and Slot advanced configurations are implemented with robust, centralized validation logic.
- **Version Diffing:** A generic backend endpoint () and a reusable frontend component () have been implemented to show changes between configuration versions. This is integrated for Paytable, Reel Strips, and Slot Advanced tabs.
- **Test Game Inventory:** Canonical test games ( and ) now exist for all core game types: SLOT, CRASH, DICE, REEL_LINES, TABLE_BLACKJACK, TABLE_POKER. This is documented in .
- **Hardening Framework:** A declarative framework for running edge-case tests has been defined in  and a conceptual  has been created. The suites are defined but disabled by default.

**Last working item**:
    - **Last item agent was working:** The agent just completed two major user-defined phases: **P0-D (Test Game Inventory Finalization)** and **P1 (Hardening Suite Definition)**. This involved creating canonical test games for all missing s, ensuring they had baseline config coverage (including positive/negative tests), generating version history for them, and defining a series of  hardening test suites in a YAML file.
    - **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - **Agent Testing Done:** Y
    - **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual verification by the user is required. The user should review the created documentation (, , ) and the updated  to confirm the completion of P0-D and the definition of P1.
    - **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1: ESLint warnings (P2)**
    - **Description:**  warnings persist across several frontend components. This is a low-priority technical debt item that does not block functionality.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**In progress Task List**:
- None. The previous tasks (P0-D, P1) have been completed and are pending user review.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks (P0-E, P0-F, P0-G):**
    *   **P0-E: Game Robot (MVP):** Create a minimal script-based Game Robot to simulate gameplay on test games, using the  as a conceptual starting point.
    *   **P0-F: Unity Integration Checklist:** Create the  document.
    *   **P0-G: Admin Panel Runbook:** Create the  user manual.
*   **Future Tasks (P1 / V1-After):**
    *   **P1 - Enable Hardening Bot:** Implement the runner for the  defined in  to execute the tests defined in .
    *   **Implement Blackjack/Poker Diff API:** The backend diff endpoint does not yet support  or . This was explicitly parked as future work.
    *   **Safety UX v1:** Implement a preset bar (Conservative/Standard/Aggressive) and a risk indicator badge for Crash and Dice advanced settings.
    -   **Slot - Paytable/Reels/Jackpots Preset Pattern:** Extend the preset system to these tabs.
    -   **Manual Game Import expansion:** The import pipeline needs to be expanded to handle all new config types.

**Completed work in this session**
- **P0-B Finalized: Slot Configuration Tabs:** Ensured E2E data round-trip for Slot Advanced, Paytable, Reels, and Jackpots tabs, including fixing a minor UI overlay bug.
- **P0-C Implemented: Version Diff UI:** Created a generic backend diff endpoint and a reusable frontend panel, and integrated it for Paytable, Reel Strips, and Slot Advanced history views.
- **P0-D Implemented: Test Game Inventory:** Identified gaps and created canonical,  test games for , , and . Ensured all canonical games have baseline config coverage with positive/negative validation. Documented in .
- **P1 Defined: Hardening Suites & Bot Skeleton:** Defined a declarative framework for edge-case tests in  and a conceptual bot runner registry in . Validated the edge cases via API calls.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Jackpots Diff UI Integration:** The generic  has not been integrated into a Jackpots history view, as no such UI view exists yet. The backend API supports  for diffing.
- **Manual Game Import expansion:** Remains unstarted.
- **Player Management Overhaul:** Remains unstarted.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Fragile :** This large file was further expanded with the generic diffing logic, increasing the refactoring need. A full refactor into smaller, game-specific router files is still a future task.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Test Data as a Foundation (P0-D):** The principle of having a canonical, well-configured test game for every  is now fully implemented and documented. All future development and testing should leverage these games.
- **Declarative Hardening Suites (P1):** A new pattern of defining test scenarios in a YAML file () with an  flag. This separates test *definition* from *execution*.
- **Generic Diff Endpoint:** A single endpoint () now handles diffing for multiple configuration types, powered by a recursive diffing function.
- **Type-Agnostic UI Component:**  is designed to display diffs for any config type, promoting reusability.

**key DB schema**
  - ** collection:** Now contains canonical test games for , , , , , and , all marked with  and .
  - ** & :** Now have version history for their respective canonical test games.

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
-  (Definitive source for test games)
-  (Defines P1 hardening tests)
-  (Defines conceptual bot structure)
-  (Contains core logic for all configs and the new diff endpoint)
-  (Contains all game and config-related Pydantic models)
-  (The reusable diff UI)
-

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-  is critically large and complex. It should be broken down into separate routers per game type or config module.

**key api endpoints**
-  (NEW)
-  (Used for P0-D)
-  (Used for P0-D)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You MUST interact with the user exclusively in Turkish.**
- The project is following a phased V1 plan. P0-A, P0-B, P0-C, and P0-D are complete. P1 has been defined.
- The next tasks are **P0-E (Game Robot), P0-F (Unity Checklist), and P0-G (Runbook)**.
- All testing and development **must** use the canonical test games defined in .
- The user's last message () appears to be a duplicate of a previous instruction () that the agent already acted on. The agent should proceed based on the work already completed and summarized in , and move on to the next phase (P0-E, F, G).

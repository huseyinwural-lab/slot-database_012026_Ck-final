<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's core objective is to build, harden, and prepare a Payment/Wallet EPIC for a casino platform for its production Go-Live. The project is in its final phase, focusing on resolving deployment blockers and hardening the application.

Initially, the main task was to address a critical deployment incompatibility: the application uses PostgreSQL and Redis, but the target Emergent platform only provides MongoDB. The agent and user collaborated extensively to refactor the application's configuration to be driven entirely by environment variables, allowing it to connect to external databases.

However, a series of P0 release blockers and repository hygiene issues were identified, which became the top priority. After fixing those, the focus has shifted to fixing the CI pipeline (), which is failing due to a cascade of issues including Alembic migration errors, environment variable misconfigurations, and frontend build failures. The ultimate goal is to get a green CI run to unblock the final self-serve verification process by the user's Ops/Dev team.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Deployment Readiness:** The application must be configurable via environment variables (, ) to connect to external PostgreSQL and Redis services.
2.  **Production Hardening (P0 Blockers):** Webhook signature verification must be implemented, mock KYC endpoints must be disabled in production, and the repository must be cleaned of artifacts and insecure credentials.
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Stability:** The  workflow must pass successfully on a Postgres-backed environment. This is the current primary goal.
4.  **Verification:** The deployment fixes must be verifiable through a self-serve evidence pack that the user's Ops/Dev team can run once the CI is stable.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack casino platform (React/FastAPI/PostgreSQL) that has undergone significant hardening. A long series of critical P0 security and hygiene issues have been resolved. The application's database and service connections are now fully configurable via environment variables.

However, the main  CI pipeline is broken. The agent has been working through a chain of failures:
- Multiple Alembic migration errors on PostgreSQL (foreign key dependencies, data type mismatches, transaction aborts) have been patched.
- CI environment configuration issues (e.g., missing ) have been addressed in the workflow files.
- The  service has been isolated into a separate  profile to simplify the main deployment.
- The agent is currently stuck trying to fix frontend build failures.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was trying to resolve a cascade of frontend CI failures. This involved multiple steps:
    1.  Fixing a yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
success Already up-to-date.
Done in 0.19s. error by updating .
    2.  Attempting to fix dozens of ESLint errors () across many React components by manually adding  to data-fetching functions.
    3.  The  command continued to fail, seemingly due to the sheer number of unresolved linting errors being treated as build failures. The agent was in a loop of fixing a few files, re-running lint/build, and seeing it fail again.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent (once the build is successful).
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The  CI pipeline is broken (P0)
-   **Issue 2:** Critical Deployment Incompatibility & Verification (P0)
-   **Issue 3:** Confirm Final Release Process Hardening (P1)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:** The  CI pipeline is broken
    -   **Description:** The main CI workflow is failing due to a chain of multiple independent issues. This is the absolute highest priority blocker.
        -   **Frontend Build Failure:** The yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. (via ) step is failing. The logs suggest this is due to a large number of ESLint warnings () being treated as errors. The agent was stuck in a loop trying to fix these manually.
        -   **Backend Test Failure:** The  was failing with a  error. The agent attempted a fix in  by managing the event loop, but a full successful test run in CI has not been confirmed since.
        -   **Environment Sanity:** The pipeline was previously failing due to  not being found and  being empty. The agent has added steps to the workflow to mitigate this, but it needs verification in a full run.
    -   **Attempted fixes:**
        -   For the frontend build, the agent manually added  to many functions in many files, but this was inefficient and did not solve the problem globally. The build still fails.
        -   For the backend tests,  was modified to manage the asyncio event loop better.
        -   For the CI environment,  and an explicit  were added to the workflow YAML.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Frontend First:** Focus on fixing the frontend build. Instead of manual, one-by-one fixes, try a more systematic approach:
            -   Run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. to see how many issues can be auto-corrected.
            -   Review the  or  configuration to see if warnings as errors can be temporarily disabled in CI to unblock the build and isolate the problem.
            -   If many components follow the same problematic data-fetching pattern, refactor one component correctly as a template and apply it to the others.
        2.  **CI/Env:** Once the frontend builds, trigger the full  workflow.
        3.  **Backend Tests:** If the  error returns, analyze the full stack trace. It's likely a fixture scope issue or an engine being created at import time.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** A green CI pipeline is the mandatory gate for any deployment or further verification. Without it, no progress can be validated.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is the primary blocker.

-   **Issue 2:** Critical Deployment Incompatibility & Verification
    -   **Description:** The original goal: verify that the app can be deployed on an external environment using environment variables for PostgreSQL and Redis. This is blocked until the CI pipeline is green.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has completed the necessary code refactoring and created comprehensive documentation (, ) for the verification process.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** This task is blocked. Once Issue 1 is resolved, the next step is to provide the user with the final evidence pack request for their Ops team to execute.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the fundamental blocker for deploying the application.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** Issue 1: The  CI pipeline is broken

-   **Issue 3:** Confirm Final Release Process Hardening
    -   **Description:** A major overhaul of the CI/CD and testing process was completed in a previous session. This work is pending the user's final review and acceptance.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** NA
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Fix the  CI Pipeline (P0)
    -   **Where to resume:** Resume by fixing the frontend build failure. The agent was stuck fixing ESLint  errors. A better strategy is needed than manual, one-off fixes.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A green CI run, which will unblock the deployment verification process.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **(P0) External Verification (P1-B, P1-B-S):** Once the CI pipeline is fixed, the next step is to guide the user's team to execute the self-serve verification packs (, ) and provide the output to confirm the deployment configuration works.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **(P1) Growth & Monetization Track:** Evolve the bonus engine, set promo risk limits, and scale the affiliate system.
-   **(P1) Collusion v2:** Implement graph-based collusion detection.
-   **(P2) Post-Go-Live Hardening:** Technical debt cleanup and further optimizations.
-   **(P2) Day-0 / Day-7 / Day-30 Ops Plan:** Define post-launch monitoring metrics and operational playbooks.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Alembic Migration Hardening:**
  - Fixed multiple  errors in migrations by ensuring tables with foreign key dependencies are created in the correct order (e.g.,  before ,  before ).
  - Fixed  for a boolean column () by changing the  from  to .
  - Removed a  anti-pattern from a migration file () that was masking SQL errors and causing  failures.
  - Consolidated duplicate  table creation logic into a single migration file () to prevent relation already exists errors.
- **CI/CD Workflow Fixes ():**
  - Added a step to  to prevent  from failing if the file is missing.
  - Explicitly set  in the workflow environment to fix Alembic authentication failures with Postgres.
  - Isolated the  service into a  profile in  to exclude it from the default CI run, simplifying the deployment target.
- **Backend Configuration & Testing:**
  - Made Redis connection optional, controlled by a  environment variable, to allow the application to start even if Redis is unavailable.
  - Attempted to fix an  loop mismatch error in backend tests by refactoring .
- **Repository Hygiene & P0 Blockers:**
  - Completed the full list of P0/Hygiene issues from the initial handoff, including implementing HMAC verification, disabling mock KYC, creating , removing secrets, and creating  files.
- **Frontend Linting (In Progress):**
  - Updated  to resolve  inconsistencies.
  - Fixed a large number of  ESLint errors across dozens of frontend components by wrapping data-fetching functions in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** The   process is failing.
    -   **Debug checklist:**
        1.  Examine the  or  build configuration. Determine if ESLint warnings are being treated as errors ( often does this).
        2.  Try running yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. to auto-resolve simple issues.
        3.  Systematically fix the remaining  errors. The  pattern is correct, but it needs to be applied consistently and with the correct dependency arrays.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** The frontend cannot be built or deployed without fixing this. It's a hard blocker for the CI pipeline.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:**  failures.
-   **Recurrence count:** 3+
-   **Status:** RESOLVED (All tests in this file now pass, and a broader set of migration/CI issues has become the new recurring problem).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Environment-Driven Configuration:** All infrastructure dependencies (DB, Redis) are configured via environment variables.
-   **Deterministic Migrations:** Ensuring Alembic migrations are idempotent and handle dependencies correctly (e.g., table creation order for foreign keys) is critical. Postgres is much stricter than SQLite.
-   **CI/CD Hardening:** The process of iteratively finding and fixing failures in a complex CI workflow () involving build, lint, migrations, and tests.
-   **Docker Compose Profiles:** Used to selectively enable/disable services (, ) in different environments (CI vs. local).
-   **React Hooks & Effects:** Correctly managing dependencies in  with  is a major focus for fixing the frontend build.

**key DB schema**
- No new schema was intentionally added. The work focused on making the existing schema, defined across many Alembic migrations, actually build correctly on PostgreSQL.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The CI workflow file, modified to add env vars and steps.
-   : Modified to use profiles for .
-   : Core logic for environment variables, including the new optional Redis feature.
-   : Numerous migration files were patched to fix Postgres-specific errors. Key ones are , , and .
-   : Modified to handle  event loops for tests.
-    & : Many files in these directories were modified to fix ESLint errors.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The frontend components have inconsistent data-fetching patterns, leading to widespread ESLint  issues. A standardized custom hook (e.g., ) could simplify this and prevent future errors.
-   The Alembic migration chain is fragile and has required multiple hot-fixes. Consolidating or squashing migrations could improve stability, but would be a high-risk operation.

**key api endpoints**
- No new endpoints were created. The focus was on making the existing application stable and deployable.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The CI Pipeline is the Main Blocker:** Your primary, immediate goal is to get the  workflow to run successfully (all green). Do not get distracted by other tasks.
-   **Fix Failures Sequentially:** The CI pipeline is a chain of dominoes. Fixing one failure (e.g., frontend lint) will likely reveal the next (e.g., frontend build, backend tests). Address them one by one.
-   **Frontend Build is the Current Wall:** The agent was stuck fixing  errors. You need a more systematic approach than fixing one file at a time. Try , and if that's not enough, focus on fixing one component perfectly and use it as a template.
-   **User is Technical and Process-Oriented:** The user expects a methodical approach. They have established a clear process of waiting for evidence packs (CI run links, logs) to verify fixes. Do not claim a fix is complete until you have this evidence.
-   **The Goal is a Single Paste Evidence:** The entire conversation has converged on the user needing a single, clean CI run from which they can get all the evidence they need to give a final GO on the deployment readiness.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   : Updated with results from P0 blocker fixes and migration tests.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
- The last 10+ messages are a deep, technical back-and-forth in Turkish between the user and the agent, diagnosing and attempting to fix a chain of CI failures.
- **The pattern:** The user runs the CI, it fails, they paste the logs. The agent analyzes the logs, identifies a root cause (e.g.,  in migration, , frontend lint errors), proposes a fix, and applies it. The user then asks the agent to confirm the next steps, which is always to re-run the CI and provide a new evidence pack.
- The conversation has covered multiple failures: Alembic FK dependencies, boolean default errors, transaction aborts, missing , and finally, the current blocker of frontend linting/build errors.
- The last user message was a yı b yi de uygulayabilirsin. hangisi gerekliyse (you can apply a or b. whichever is necessary), and then tamam devam et (ok, continue), giving the agent the green light to proceed with the proposed fixes to unblock the CI.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The application is not deployable because the primary CI/CD pipeline () is failing. Multiple blockers across the frontend build and backend tests have been identified.
-   **Mocked:** A mock poker provider and mock KYC flow still exist.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Stripe:** Payment processing.
-   **Adyen:** Payment processing.
-   **PostgreSQL / SQLModel:** Backend database.
-   **Redis (ARQ):** Background job queuing.
-   **APScheduler:** Background jobs.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:**
    -   
    -   
    -   
-   **Known regressions:** The CI pipeline is the main regression. It was likely working at some point before the recent flurry of changes.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent got stuck in a repetitive loop of manually fixing individual frontend linting errors instead of taking a more strategic approach. It could have tried using , modifying the linting rules in the CI, or refactoring the problematic components more holistically. It failed to break the cycle of fix one file, re-lint, fail, repeat.</analysis>
